# MK4 wheel scroll is a momentary ~50 ms click (WHEEL_ACC_BUTTONS byte2, decoded from route 00000101), so the
# shared VCruiseHelper only ever sees a short press = +/-1 km/h. To match the OEM's +/-5 step WITHOUT editing
# shared code, we stretch each click into a synthetic long-press: VCruiseHelper applies +/-5 once its press
# timer crosses CRUISE_LONG_PRESS (50 frames). Holding the synthetic press for 54 frames crosses exactly one
# boundary (one +/-5) and releases in the safe window (timer > 50) so it does NOT also register a spurious +1.
# A new click while still held adds another 50-frame cycle, so rapid clicks accumulate (3 quick clicks -> +/-15).
# There is no separate wheel button on the tapped buses to key this off. Validated offline vs the real
# VCruiseHelper. Cost: the step lands ~0.5 s after the click (the long-press threshold). MK4-only.
